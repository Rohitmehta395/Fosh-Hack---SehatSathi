## Overview

SehatSaathi bridges the gap between complex medical jargon and everyday understanding. It is built for the common person — especially in India — where medical literacy and language barriers often prevent people from truly understanding their own health reports.

**Core promise:** Upload your report → get a friendly, easy-to-read summary → in your language → in seconds.

- 🤝 **Hinglish** — Casual Hindi-English mixed for accessibility

### 🔐 Authentication
- **Email/Password** signup and login with JWT tokens
- **Google OAuth 2.0** one-tap login via Google Identity Services

## API Reference

### Auth — `/auth`

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Body |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/signup` | Register new user | `{ name, email, password }` |
| POST | `/auth/login` | Login with email/password | `{ email, password }` |
| POST | `/auth/google` | Google OAuth login | `{ token }` (Google ID token) |

### Report — `/report`

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Body |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/report/analyze` | Analyze uploaded report | `multipart/form-data` with `file` field |

### History — `/history`

> All history routes require `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header.

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Body |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/history` | Fetch all history for logged-in user | — |
| POST | `/history/save` | Save a new analysis result | `{ fileName, result }` |
| DELETE | `/history/:id` | Delete a history entry by ID | — |

---

## Authentication

### Flow — Email/Password
1. User submits form → validated by **Joi** middleware (`AuthValidation.js`)
2. Password hashed with **bcrypt** (10 salt rounds) on signup
3. On login, `bcrypt.compare` verifies password
4. A **JWT** is signed with `process.env.JWT_SECRET` and returned
5. Frontend stores token in `localStorage` and Redux store (`profileToken` slice)
6. On app load, `Header.jsx` rehydrates Redux from `localStorage`

### Flow — Google OAuth
1. Google Identity Services renders a sign-in button in `LoginPage.jsx`
2. On callback, the Google ID token is sent to `POST /auth/google`
3. Backend verifies the token with `OAuth2Client.verifyIdToken()`
4. If user doesn't exist → new user created with `provider: 'google'`
5. If user exists with `provider: 'local'` → rejected with an error message
6. JWT returned to frontend, same session flow as email login

### Token Validation (History routes)
History controller extracts and verifies the JWT from the `Authorization` header directly — no separate middleware layer.

## AI Pipeline

### Stage 1 — Google Gemini (Vision Analysis)

- **Endpoint:** `process.env.GEMINI_API_URL` + `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY`
- **Input:** `medical_prompt.txt` system instructions + base64-encoded file
- **Prompt behaviour:**
  - Validates document is actually a medical report
  - Extracts patient name, age, and sex
  - Highlights only abnormal or important values (skips normal ones)
  - Each finding prefixed with ➡️ on its own line
  - Ends with a short 3–4 sentence Summary
- **Fallback:** If Sarvam fails, the raw Gemini output is returned to the user

### Stage 2 — Sarvam AI (Multilingual Refinement)

- **Endpoint:** `https://api.sarvam.ai/v1/chat/completions`
- **Model:** `sarvam-m`
- **Input:** Formatted Gemini output
- **Output:** Three-section response — English, Hindi, Hinglish
- **Prompt source:** `sarvam_prompt.txt` (with BOM stripping for Windows compatibility)
- **Post-processing:** `<think>...</think>` tags stripped from output

### State Management (Redux)

```
Store
└── token (profileToken slice)
    ├── token: string | null
    ├── addToken(token)     → sets token
    ├── removeToken()       → clears token (logout)
    └── setToken(token)     → rehydrates from localStorage
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 18
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)
- Google Cloud Console project with OAuth 2.0 credentials
- Gemini API key (Google AI Studio)
- Sarvam AI API key

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
# Create .env file with variables listed above
npm start
# Server runs on http://localhost:4000
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# App runs on http://localhost:5173
```

## Security

| Concern | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Password storage | bcrypt with 10 salt rounds |
| Auth tokens | JWT signed with secret, stored in localStorage |
| Google tokens | Verified server-side via `OAuth2Client.verifyIdToken()` |
| Input validation | Joi schemas on all auth endpoints |
| File uploads | Memory storage only — files never written to disk |
| History access | JWT verified on every history route request |
| CORS | Enabled globally via `cors()` middleware |

> **Medical reports** are processed entirely in memory (Multer `memoryStorage`) and converted to base64 before being sent to the AI APIs. No report file is ever written to disk or stored in the database — only the text result is saved to history.
